# Flights Within the USA

## Exploratory analysis

Turns out that there are some flights to airports outside of 
the USA.

```{r}
airports <- read.csv("airports.csv")
table(airports$country)
```

## Appendix

We can run shell commands within an R Markdown document via
`bash` code chunks.

```{bash}
ls
```
